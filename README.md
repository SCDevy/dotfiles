# dotfiles

Stephen's dotfiles.

## TODO
- read node global installs from json, property for latest vs stable
- add color and formatting to prompts
- add file sync applications (Dropbox, GDrive) to Brewfile
- TODO: check before sudos (so prompt doesn't show every time), or add check for "requires sudo"
